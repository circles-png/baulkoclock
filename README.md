A bell times extension for Baulkham Hills High School.

## Building from source

### Requirements

- Windows as there is only a `build.bat`. A `build.sh` is coming soon for MacOS and Linux users.
- `Node.js`
- `npm`
- `git` (optional, you can just download from source)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/circles-png/baulkoclock.git` or download the source code from the [releases page](https://github.com/circles-png/baulkoclock/releases).
2. Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.
3. Run the build script with `build.bat` or `build.sh` depending on your OS.

Build output will be in `dist/` and built web extensions will be in `web-ext-artifacts`.
